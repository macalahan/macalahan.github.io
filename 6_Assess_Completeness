# Assembly Quality Control and Annotation

## Step 1: Busco
Busco is a software that assesses genome completeness based on evolutionarily-informed expectations of gene content of near-universal single-copy orthologs by searching for these select sets of orthologous genes. There are several databases that can be used with Busco, and can be downloaded [here](https://busco.ezlab.org).

Busco can be run with or without internet, so we will consider two ways to run this software:

#### Option 1:
For option 1, we will assume that you have internet connection on the node you are running your job on. 
Note: Busco does not have the ability to direct an output file to a different folder than the folder you submit the job from, even with a path identified. In this case, consider creating a Busco folder.
```Bash
#make directory / folder
mkdir Busco
#
#change directory to your Busco folder
cd Busco
```
Be sure that it is available and loaded on your HPC, and write and submit a job with the following code:
```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
echo + NSLOTS = $NSLOTS
#
busco  -o output_file -i /path/to/input/fasta/file.fasta -l mammalia_odb10 -c $NSLOTS -m genome
#
echo = `date` job $JOB_NAME done
#
#Explanation:
#-o: name of the output folder and files
#-i: input file (FASTA)
#-l: lineage - ex. mammalian / name of the database (This will automatically connected and download the database from the BUSCO website)
#-c: number of CPUs
#-m: mode (options are *genome*, transcriptome, proteins)
```

#### Option 2:
If you do not have internet connection on the node you are running the software on, you can download the database and run the program offline. 
```Bash
#make directory / folder
mkdir Busco
#
#change directory to your Busco folder
cd Busco
#
#download database from web, ex. mammal database
wget https://busco-data.ezlab.org/v5/data/lineages/mammalia_odb10.2021-02-19.tar.gz
#
#extract files within Busco folder
tar -zxf mammalia_odb10.2021-02-19.tar.gz
```
Write and submit a job with the following code:
```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
echo + NSLOTS = $NSLOTS
#
busco  -o output_file -i /path/to/input/fasta/file.fasta -l mammalia_odb10 -c $NSLOTS -m genome --offline --download_path /path/to/datasets
#
echo = `date` job $JOB_NAME done
#
#Explanation:
#-o: name of the output folder and files
#-i: input file (FASTA)
#-l: lineage - ex. mammalian / name of the database (This will automatically connected and download the database from the BUSCO website)
#-c: number of CPUs
#-m: mode (options are *genome*, transcriptome, proteins)
```
