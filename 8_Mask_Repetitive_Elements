# Assembly Quality Control and Completeness

## Step 3: RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker
The next step is to mask and annotate repeats with RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker. 

RepeatModeler is a repeat-identifying software that can provide a list of repeat family sequences to mask repeats in a genome with RepeatMasker. For more information, or to download, visit [RepeatModeler](http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/).

RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. the output of the program is a detailed annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked. For more information, or to download, visit [RepeatMasker](http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html).

We will apply this software in the following steps:
##### 1) Build a database for RepeatModeler
##### 2) Run RepeatModeler
##### 3) Run RepeatMasker to annotate repeats

### 1) Build a Database for RepeatModeler
This can be run on an interactive node, or by submitting a job with the following code:
```Bash
#build database
BuildDatabase -name database_name /path/to_assembly/file.fasta
#
#Explanation
#-name: name to be given to the database
#genome file in fasta format
```
### 2) Run RepeatModeler
Write and submit a job script with the following code:
```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
echo + NSLOTS = $NSLOTS
#
RepeatModeler -database databasa_name -pa 36 -engine ncbi > repeatmodeler_cl_out.log
#
#Explanation
#-database: The prefix name of a XDF formatted sequence database containing the genomic sequence to use when building repeat models
#-pa: number of cpus
#-engine: The name of the search engine we are using. I.e abblast/wublast or ncbi (rmblast version).
#Note the new version of repeatmodeler calls another program called LTRStruct.
#-LTRStruct: enables the optional LTR structural finder.
```

### 3) Run RepeatMasker to Annotate Repeats
Write and submit a job script with the following code:
```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
echo + NSLOTS = $NSLOTS
#
RepeatMasker -pa $NSLOTS -xsmall -gff -lib consensi.fa.classified -dir ../repeatmasker /path/to_assembly/file.fasta
#
echo = `date` job $JOB_NAME done
#
#Explanation
#-lib: repeatmodeler repbase database to be search
#-pa: number of cpus
#-xs
