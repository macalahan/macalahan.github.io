# Genome Assembly and Statistics

## Step 5: Fasta Metadata Parser
Fasta Metadata Parser is a python script that summarizes statistics from assembly files. For more information, or to download, visit [Fasta_Metadata_Parser](https://pypi.org/project/assembly-stats/).

The following statistics are produced:

###### Total number of base pairs:
###### Total number of contigs:
###### N90:
###### N80:
###### N70:
###### N60:
###### N50:
###### L90:
###### L80:
###### L70:
###### L60:
###### L50:
###### GC content:
###### Median contig size:
###### Mean contig size:
###### Longest contig is:
###### Shortest contig is:

Nx - the largest contig size at which at least x% of bases are contained in contigs at least this length
  ex. if N50 = 60 - at least half of the nucleotides in the assembly belongs to contigs with the N50 length of 60 nucleotides or longer

Note: You can calculate N50 for contigs and scaffolds. If N50 of contigs and N50 of scaffolds are similar, this generally indicates good assembly coverage

To run the Fasta Metadata Parser, be sure that this module is available and loaded on your HPC, and write and submit a job script with the following code:

```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
#
assembly_stats <ASSEMBLY> > assembly_stats.out
#
echo
