## Step 3: Genomescope and Jellyfish

Genomescope is a web-tool used to estimate genome size, heterozygosity, and repeat content from short short read sequence data using a kmer-based statistical approach. To read more, or to access, visit [Genomescope](http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/). To run Genomescope, you will need to apply [Jellyfish](https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish), a tool used to quickly and efficiently count kmers in DNA. Apply Genomescope and Jellyfish in the following steps:
##### 1) Count kmers using jellyfish
##### 2) Generate histogram using jellyfish
##### 3) Download histogram, and submit it to Genomescope

------

### 1) Count K-mers using Jellyfish
k-mer - all the possible nucleotide sequences of a certain length, ex. K=2 all the possible kmers are: AA AT AC AG TA TT TC TG CA CT CC CG GA GT GC GG
Be sure the Jellyfish module is available and uploaded on your HPC.

First, unzip your files
```Bash
#applying an * will unzip all .fastq.gz files
gzip -d *.fastq.gz
```

Then, write and submit a job script with the following code:
```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
#
jellyfish count -C -m 21 -t $NSLOTS -s 800000000 /path/to/fastq/files/*.fastq -o reads.jf 
#
echo = `date` job $JOB_NAME done
#
#Explanation
#-m = kmer length
#-s = RAM
#-C = "canonical kmers"

```

------

### 2) Generate a histogram file
Write and submit a job script with the following code:
```Bash
echo + `date` job $JOB_NAME started in $QUEUE with jobID=$JOB_ID on $HOSTNAME
#
jellyfish histo -t $NSLOTS reads.jf > reads.histo
#
echo = `date` job $JOB_NAME done
```

------
### 3) Download histogram, and submit it to Genomescope
First, download the histogram file using ffsend
```Bash
ffsend upload reads.histo
```
Next, upload the histogram file to [Genomescope](http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/).

Record the url that Genomescope generates for you, so you can easily return to view your results in the future.
